TASK: Combined Results

1) For each lists of 1000 links, store the depth (number) before a given set of links for that depth.
Top 1000 links are added to the resultant list based on the priority, which is the depth of the links. Links on 
depth 1 are more important than links on depth 2 and so on.
2) Now add all links from list one which are from depth 1. (assuming no repetition of links)
3) After all links from list one's 1st depth have been added to the resultant list, start adding links from second listâ€™s 1st depth  to the resultant
list and keep a check if the added link has been previously added or not, if not then add that in the resultant list otherwise
ignore. Now do the same with other depths.
4) If in case we have exhausted one list as there can be duplicated in each list, then append the rest of the links from the other list.
