APPROACH FOR TASK 2

APPROACH FOR TASK 2.A

Seed URL and keyword is being taken from the user as the input.
Politeness policy is implemented by putting the 'time.sleep(1)' (sleep 1 sec) before each GET request
Implemented Breadth First Search for the task. That is the links at initial depth and crawled, and then the crawler moves to the next depth
(We may not even reach depth 5 if we cross the limit of maximum URL's at a lower depth)
As a result, the crawler fetches unique 1000 URL's . For a focussed search, I added the keyword 'solar' in the crawler function;
which fetches all the links with 'solar' in its href or in the anchor text. As outlined, main page is not considered in the search.

APPROACH FOR TASK 2.B

Seed URL and keyword is being taken from the user as the input.
Politeness policy is implemented by putting the 'time.sleep(1)' (sleep 1 sec) before each GET request.
Implemented Depth First Search for the task.
Therefore, the crawler will recursively use the first link at each depth to reach the lower depth till it reaches depth 5.
After completing the links at depth 5 for 1st link of 4th depth, the crawler will go to 2nd link of 4th depth and will again 
go to 5th depth's link and this will continue until it is finished with 1st depth's link.
For a focussed search, I added the keyword 'solar' in the crawler function;
which fetches all the links with 'solar' in its href or in the anchor text. As outlined, main page is not considered in the search.
