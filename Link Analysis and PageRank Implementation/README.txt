1) 
Source_Code.py has the implementation of the page rank algorithm.
To run the file : python Source_Code.py
The algorithm runs on the small graph as stored in the file GraphNodes.txt

in Task1, the graph file generated for G1 is provided as G1.txt

2)
For Task2B, the file Task2_G2.py contains the implementation of iterative version of PageRank algorithm on G2 until their
PageRank values "converge".
To run the file: python Task2G2.py

The perplexity values obtained in each round until convergence has been shared in the following files:
Graph G1: PerplexityValues_G1.docx
Graph G2: PerplexityValues_G2.docx

In Task 2, reporting the top 50 pages by their docID and PageRank score after sorting by their final page rank score have been shared in the following files:
Graph G1: Sorted_Pages_G1.docx
Graph G2: Sorted_Pages_G2.docx


3)
Finally the qualitative analysis for the task3 is provided in the file Task3 Analysis.docx
