Taking the first 5 results of both methods of ranking of documents we find that when we are using lucene
simple analyzer the ranking considers more of parameters for ranking for eg: searching for "global warming potential" the highest ranking document 
was that contained a part of searched query in document title ie "Global_warming.html" while the the BM25 score only considers the content of the documents and not the title for ranking
so depending upon the requirements we can use both the alternatives.
